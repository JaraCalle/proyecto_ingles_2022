                <p>The Sirius Black character, search tell us that the revenge and the rage never are going to solve anything. The revenge only bring problems and pain, if Sirius had killed Pettergrew, his personality would change and some person were died, like Beak and Remus. But if we take good choices and take care of the others, all the things will be better.</p>
